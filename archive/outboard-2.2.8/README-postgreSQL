--== UNSUPPORTED POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION ==--

2012-03-28

By default, OutBoard requires a MySQL database. However, a generous user 
(Ben Cadieux <ben.cadieux@gmail.com>) has created a few replacement files
that will allow OutBoard to run with a PostgreSQL database.

Note: This is an UNSUPPORTED configuration. Please contact the above person
if you have problems using it.

To enable this support, look for these three files:

lib/OutboardDatabase-postgresql.php
include/create_tables-postgresql.php
include/install-postgresql.php

Then just rename them by removing '-postgresql' from the name. You should MAKE A BACKUP of
the original (MySQL-based) files in case you need to use them later.
